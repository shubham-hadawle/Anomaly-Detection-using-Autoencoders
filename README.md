### Autoencoders
Autoencoders are a subset of neural network architectures where the output dimension is the same as the input dimension. Autoencoders have two networks, an encoder and a decoder. The encoder encodes its input data into a smaller dimensional space, called the latent space. The decoder network tries to reconstruct the original data from the latent encoding. Typically, the encoder and decoder are symmetric, and the latent space is a bottleneck. The autoencoder has to learn essential characteristics of the data to be able to do a high-quality reconstruction of the data during decode.
